            <p>Waves of the Mediterranean in Pangbourne
<p>Elixir Kitchen recently opened its doors in Pangbourne, serving selected Mediterranean dishes from Turkish, Greek and Italian cuisines. The family-owned local restaurant aims to present the true hospitality of its Anatolian roots to its guests. The name ‘La’De’ is made up of two parts, derived from the names of the owner’s two children.</p>
<p>Using fresh and local seasonal ingredients, chefs at La’De Kitchen take great care in presenting guests with deliciously made dishes. Anatolian hospitality and warmth can be felt immediately as soon as guests step foot into La’De Kitchen, with its complimenting glitzy and buzzy decor. The Restaurant is an ideal place to mark important occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. The easy-going vibe and cool atmosphere make first dates more memorable.<p>
<p>The family-friendly restaurant can also cater for large groups. From mezes to kebabs, there are dishes that cater for every dietary need. If you love seafood, there are plenty of options, specially selected from Billingsgate. The experienced kitchen team works tirelessly from the morning towards the busy service times. The house special pistachio cheesecake with a nicely brewed Turkish tea will leave you wanting more. A sip of Turkish coffee means 40 years of friendship — as the legend goes — will create a long- lasting relationship with guests. The popular sutlac and baklava desserts are also available for those who opt for more traditional tastes.</p>
